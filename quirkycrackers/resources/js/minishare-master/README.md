Minishare
=========
A really simple sharing widget by David Hewitson.

It hangs down the right hand side of the page, and is fixed in place with CSS when you scroll.

Designed to be minimalist - does not require any FB SDKs or configuration of any kind.

Instructions
------------

Include jQuery and ./minishare-0.0.1.js

Call $.miniShare() to show the widget.

Options (all optional):
-----------------------

- url - url to share (default is the current page)
- message - message to show above the icons
- done_message - message to show after sharing
- twitter_message - message to include in the tweet. This prefaces the URL.
- html - a string of HTML to use for the widget.

	$.miniShare( { 
		message: "hey!", 
		url: "http://google.com" 
	});
